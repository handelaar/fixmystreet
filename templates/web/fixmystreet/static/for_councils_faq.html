<h1>Questions about FixMyStreet for Councils</h1>

<h2 id="general">General information</h2>

<dl>

<dt>What is FixMyStreet For Councils?</dt>

<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet is a street issue-reporting and mapping application
designed specifically for local authority websites.

<p>It integrates seamlessly with council websites, fully reflecting their look
and feel. All copy, categories, information, reporting fields and links can be
customised to the specific needs of the council. FixMyStreet can also be
connected to a CRM or fault management system for automatic two-way updates.

<p>The software is open source and is based on mySociety’s award-winning
FixMyStreet.com platform, which has been operating for five years. It is the
most widely-used street issue web application in the UK, sending over 5,000
reports to local authorities each month.
</dd>

<dt>Who built it?</dt>

<dd>
FixMyStreet for Councils was built by mySociety Ltd, a company registered in
England and Wales, company number 03277032. mySociety Ltd is wholly owned by
the charity UK Citizens Online Democracy (charity number 1076346). All profits
are returned to the charity.
</dd>

<dt>What are the benefits for councils?</dt>

<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet for Councils will save you and your residents time. It will reduce duplicate reports and encourage the shift of street issue reporting to the web.

<p>It also places a highly usable, attractive application on your website, and a very simple channel for responding to your residents if you wish to do so.

<p>Most councils get a high volume of telephone calls to report street issues - by moving even a small proportion of that online, you can make significant savings over time.
</dd>

<dt>Why is FixMyStreet more effective than standard reporting forms?</dt>

<dd>
<p>As a rule, people do not enjoy filling in onerous forms on the web. They
often span several pages and require a lot of personal information &ndash; so many
people resort to calling instead.

<p>Reporting on FixMyStreet is extremely simple and quick. The user pinpoints
the location of the problem on a map, provides a description and a photo if
they have one, and their email address. You’ll receive the email address with
the problem report, so your officers can get in touch if they need to.

<p>Using a map as a way to locate an issue is very useful &ndash; people often don’t
know the exact nearest address, but they can show where it is on a map.

<p>Finally, FixMyStreet allows you to comment on a report or update its status
&ndash; your update will be available for everyone interested to see on the website,
further reducing avoidable contact.
</dd>

<dt>What is the difference between FixMyStreet.com and FixMyStreet for Councils?</dt>

<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet.com is a national street issue reporting website that enables
anyone anywhere in Great Britain to report a problem to their council. The
reports are delivered to councils by email.

<p>FixMyStreet for Councils is a product for council websites to enable their
residents to report issues to them. It becomes a natural part of the council’s
site, can be included in the list of top tasks, integrates council-relevant
information, and can be linked with council’s backoffice.

<p>It uses the same software platform as the FixMyStreet.com site; issues
reported to a council on its own website are also shown on FixMyStreet.com, and
vice-versa. Read the Implementation FAQ above to learn why this approach really
works.

</dd>

<dt>Which councils already have FixMyStreet?</dt>

<dd>
The London Borough of Bromley will soon be launching our upgraded FixMyStreet
for Councils product. For existing implementations, have a look at the
<a href="http://barnet.fixmystreet.com/">London Borough of Barnet’s website</a>
or <a href="http://southampton.fixmystreet.com/">Southampton City Council’s
website</a>. Meanwhile, West Berkshire Council is an example of a back-office
integration - they receive problems reported on FixMyStreet directly into their
CRM.
</dd>

<dt>Is there a mobile version of the FixMyStreet for Councils product?</dt>

<dd>
<p>As more and more people use their smartphones for online tasks, we make it
easy for councils to enable mobile street issue reporting. We offer two
products: 
<ul>
<li>A mobile web version of FixMyStreet &ndash; this presents users with a
mobile-optimised version of a council FixMyStreet web app, and enables mobile
reporting by simply entering a URL of the council’s web reporting page in their
mobile browser
<li>Mobile Apps - some users do prefer to use downlodable apps, so we are
currently developing iPhone and Android Apps with the capability to include
council branding. If you are interested, <a
href="mailto:hello&#64;mysociety.org">let us know</a>.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>What is the cost to councils?</dt>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>The front end product costs £3,500 in year one, reducing to £1,500 per annum in future years.
<li>The mobile web version costs £3,000 in year one and £1,000 per annum subsequently.
<li>Back-end integration costs depend on the complexity of your systems. Prices start at £3,500 in year one, then  £1,500 per annum.
</ul>

<p>The prices are all-inclusive, covering installation, updates, unlimited
problem reports and user training. There are no hidden fees. Please see <a
href="http://www.mysociety.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FixMyStreet_for_councils_2012.pdf">our
brochure</a> for more detail on what’s included.

<p>There’s no commitment beyond the first 12 months, so you won’t be locked
into a lengthy contract.

</dl>
<h2 id="implementing">Implementing FixMyStreet for Councils</h2>
<dl>

<dt>How easy is it to implement FixMyStreet on a council website?</dt>

<dd>
Extremely easy. Because we run FixMyStreet as a cloud service, all you need to do is to provide details of your website’s colour scheme, fonts, and any customised links or information you’d like to include. We will do all the work in setting up your issue reporting application. The implementation can take as little as a week, and requires minimal work from your web team.
</dd>

<dt>Can we integrate FixMyStreet with the council’s CRM or fault management system?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Absolutely. Integrating with your back-office system ensures maximum efficiencies  - all reports go straight into your database. When their status changes, updates can be automatically pushed out onto your website as well as to FixMyStreet.com. We are able to integrate with any back-office system.

<p>We understand that each council has its own processes which have evolved over time. We will work with you to find the best integration solution to ensure minimum disruption to your work, while helping make your processes simpler and more streamlined.

<p>If you’d like us to advise on the best integration options for you, get in touch. Our advice is completely free - we are always keen to talk to councils and learn about your needs.
</dd>

<dt>What is the technical architecture of FixMyStreet?</dt>

<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet for councils uses the same <a
href="https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet">open source code base</a> and
runs on the same servers as the national FixMyStreet site. At the same time it
has been designed to allow customisation of both design and functionality.
Using the URL of the site visited the code determines which version of
FixMyStreet to display and loads the appropriate design and customisations.

<p>If you have back end integration then new reports to your council will be
sent to your CRM through the agreed mechanism ( e.g. Open311 ). If we cannot
send a report to you then it will be put back on the queue and we will try
again later so you won’t miss any reports.
</dd>

<dt>Why is linking FixMyStreet for Councils with the national FixMyStreet.com website a good idea?</dt>

<dd>

<p>There are three key benefits. First, by using the same underlying platform we can spread the cost of maintaining and hosting the system across the national site and different council users. This helps to keep prices low. Plus, we carry out all the technical maintenance and support, so you don’t need to.

<p>Second, issues reported on FixMyStreet.com are also shown on your Council’s website, avoiding duplicate reports by different residents.

<p>Third, the customised features on your own FixMyStreet (such as categories, information you gather from customers, additional details on issues the council is not responsible for, etc) will also be reflected on FixMyStreet.com. So wherever your residents report issues, they will get the right features and information from the council.
</dd>

<dt>Do you offer training?</dt>

<dd>
Yes. We offer a free two-hour remote training session to your users. If your location is within two hours’ travel from one of our FixMyStreet team members, we will provide training in person.
</dd>

<dt>What level of support do you provide after implementation?</dt>

<dd>
<p>We will provide technical support, address any questions, and make tweaks to your system if required. We will also go out of our way to help you with non-technical issues based on our significant experience with online problem reporting.

<p>Throughout our contract with you, we will always be available by email or on the phone, and will get back to you quickly.

</dl>
<h2 id="reporting">Problem reporting</h2>
<dl>

<dt>Can we customise report categories and information requested?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Yes. You can add the categories most relevant to your council, and remove ones that are not. Your customised categories will appear on both your website’s FixMyStreet implementation, and on the national FixMystreet.com website.

<p>You can also customise information requested for each issue type - for example, Southampton council asks its customers to report the approximate pothole size, to help prioritise its work.
</dd>

<dt>How can we deal with issues that the council is not responsible for?</dt>

<dd>
Most councils already get residents phoning up or emailing them about problems not within their remit. FixMyStreet can help reduce this in two ways:
We can include the most commonly misreported issues in the categories list so when a users selects these, we can give them alternative contact information. If there are known geographical areas that council is not responsible for, we can alert users to that when they click on the map, provided you have given us this information.
Alternatively, if you have contact details in relevant organisations, we can instead email reports to them, while telling the user that these are not the council’s responsibility.
</dd>

<dt>How are reports delivered to the council?</dt>

<dd>
<p>If your FixMyStreet is not integrated with your CRM or back-office system, you will receive reports by email to email addresses that you specify. Different type of problems can be sent to different addresses if you wish.

<p>With back-office integration, reports will go straight into your CRM or fault management system.
</dd>

<dt>What information is provided in a problem report?</dt>

<dd>
<p>You will receive the following information:
<ul>
<li>Issue category
<li>Precise location reported (in both latitude/longitude and easting/northing)
<li>Subject and issue description (we encourage users to give as much detail as possible)
<li>Link to a photo of the problem if the user has added one (we don’t send the actual photos so that we don’t clog your system)
<li>The user’s verified email address and phone number if given, so you can contact them directly if you wish
<li>A link to the issue on FixMyStreet for you to update the issue if required.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>How precise is location information provided in FixMyStreet?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Very. The user clicks on a map that includes useful information for
reporting, such as building positions and footpaths, so they can tell you the
location as precisely as they can.

<p>This approach also helps capture superior location data even when the user
does not know the exact address.

<p>We will send you the co-ordinates for the point clicked on the map, as well
as the nearest street address as an additional data point. You can also view
the map directly on the issue report page.
</dd>

<dt>Can we reflect more granular report statuses than just open and fixed?</dt>

<dd>
Yes. As a client council you get a selection of problem statuses, including:
Investigating, Planned, In Progress, Fixed and Closed.
</dd>

</dl>
<h2 id="best">Getting the best out of FixMyStreet</h2>
<dl>

<dt>Can we add photos showing that council has dealt with an issue?</dt>

<dd>
Yes - you can easily post a photo as an update to a report on your website. These will also be shown on the national FixMyStreet.com site.
</dd>

<dt>What can we do to help shift users to online reporting instead of calling us up?</dt>

<dd>
Online reporting is better for you and your residents, as it’s quick, effective and cheap. Good technology will certainly encourage the shift, but to make it fully effective you could do a a few things to help.
Direct residents to report issues on your website when they are in the telephone queue
When someone reports an issue to your call centre, tell them that next time they can do it much quicker online
Encourage council employees or other relevant organisations to report issues online
Respond to problem reports online, so that your residents know you engage well through this channel.
</dd>

<dt>How can a council respond to issue reports?</dt>

<dd>
<p>If you choose the back-office integration option, when an issue status
changes in your CRM or fault management system, it can also automatically
update on both your website and the national FixMyStreet website. This assumes
that your system can support automatic updates (most systems can).

<p>If your back-office is not integrated, you can still easily respond by
changing the status manually on the website, or adding a few words of
commentary. This simple process is much quicker than a telephone call or email.
</dd>

<dt>How can we contact the person submitting the report if we need more information?</dt>

<dd>
Our software encourages users to submit as much information as possible, along with photographs. If you do need additional details, you can either post your question as an update to the issue online, or email the user directly (you will get their email address with the issue report).
</dd>

<dt>We are unable to fix every problem, in particular in the current budget environment. How do we deal with this?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Whether reported online or not, there are some issues that a council will
decide not to fix because it needs to prioritise more important problems.

<p>Our online reporting application gives you a direct channel to explain to
your residents why certain problems cannot be addressed. This will lead to a
more open, constructive relationship. This may be a big culture change - we are
happy to support you with our experience in this area.

<p>When deciding not to deal with a problem, you can close it so that it does
not show as an open problem.
</dd>

<dt>We are worried about being swamped with high volume of online reports. What can we do?</dt>

<dd>
While the volume of online reporting is likely to increase (a good thing, as it
replaces phone calls and alerts you to issues you didn’t know about), it
usually happens gradually, giving you plenty of time to adjust. We can stage
the introduction of your new reporting app to make the process even smoother.
</dd>

<dt>Does FixMyStreet for Councils offer reporting functionality?</dt>

<dd>
<p>We are currently working on a new reporting dashboard for councils,
accessible through a separate council log-in. This will have detailed reporting
on issue categories, timelines, statuses and help you identify emerging
hotspots.

<p>Any new council implementation from April 2012 will have this new
functionality. Please get in touch if you’d like more detail.
</dd>

<dt>I’d like to discuss options for my council. What do I do?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Just drop us a line to <a
href="mailto:hello&#64;mysociety.org">hello&#64;mysociety.org</a> and we will get back
to you as soon as possible.

<p>We will be happy to advise you on the options, and recommend an
implementation approach to fit your needs based on our experience.
